Parking Ticket Notes:

====== 12-17-18 =======

Three different kinds of data extracts:
	Payment Extract
	Ticket Extract
		Difficult to read [into R] because there are more columns than there are column names
			**NEED TO LOOK AT RAW DATA IN TEXT EDITOR AND SEE IF SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE ADDED OR NOT**
	Penalty Extract
	Updated/loaded daily


One periodic larger ticket file
	Not pipe deliniated
		Looks like XML/HTML

Each file contains the previous dates payment and ticket info


Analysis ideas:
	-Payment types by median/mean amount of ticket price
		Are people paying in cash for smaller amounts vs larger amounts
	-Error correction tickets by price/method, reason, etc.
		Will need to connect this dataset to the ticket dataset in order to do this one
	



Payments dataset:
	-Pay.Type
		Possible values: 
			"Payment"
				Obviously it was just a standard payment
			"Error Corr"
				Assuming it's a correction of an error
				There are not many entries per day
					Both errors that charged too much and too little
	-Pay.Ticket.Number
		Unique identifier for each ticket
			This is going to be our primary/foreign key for the resulting dataset
	-Pay.Accnt.Desc
		Account Description
			Describes what kind of payment portal was used to pay the ticket
	-Pay.Method
		The actual means with which the ticket was paid
			Credit card, cash, etc.

		The date on which the payment was processed
	-Pay.Proc.Time
		The time of day that the payment was processed
	-Pay.Deposit.Date
		The date on which the payment was deposited
	-Pay.Batch.Num
		?? Assuming a batch is a group of tickets that a person needs to pay off
			Maybe they were behind and needed to pay off 2 tickets, this could be one batch
				Or they just paid off one ticket and that's a batch
		?? Could also be just what the clerk did, as in the payment clerk's workload at that point...
